## Quick Start

1. Set up the environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example` below). If you don't have a preexisting database, the easiest way to get started is to use the Neon Postgres database.

  ```
  {{{ env_example }}}
  ```

2. Push the schema to the database. You need to do this every time the schema in `src/server/db/schema.ts` changes.

  ```
  pnpm run db:push
  ```

  You can look at the current state of the database by visiting Drizzle Studio.

  ```
   pnpm run db:studio
  ```

3. Download all dependencies. You need to do this every time the dependencies in `package.json` changes.

  ```
  pnpm install
  ```

4. Start the development server.

  ```
  pnpm run dev
  ```

  After a second, you'll see this text appear in the terminal:

  ```
  â–² Next.js 14.2.15
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env
  ```
  
  Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the development server.
