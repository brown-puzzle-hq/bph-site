# Administering the Hunt

1. [Navigation](#navigation)
2. [Hinting and Errata](#hinting-and-errata)
3. [Team Management](#team-management)

#### Navigation

For admins, there is an `admin` section and a `hunt` section with different navbars. You can navigate using the navbar or the command palette (`Cmd-K` or `Ctrl-K`).

#### Hinting and Errata

These can be managed in the `admin` section under `admin/hints` and `admin/errata`.

#### Team Management

Team password resets can be made in `teams/[id]`. Don't change them directly in the Drizzle database. It won't work correctly because passwords need to be hashed.
