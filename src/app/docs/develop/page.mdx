## Quick Start

1. Populate the environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example` below). If you don't have a preexisting database, the easiest way to get started is to create a Neon Postgres database through Vercel.

```
# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional *required* environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Next Auth (required)
# You can generate a new secret on the command line with:
# openssl rand -base64 32
# https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret
AUTH_SECRET=""
AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Remember to change this for production
AUTH_DRIZZLE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/db

# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL=""
POSTGRES_DATABASE=""
POSTGRES_HOST=""
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=""
POSTGRES_URL=""
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=""
POSTGRES_URL_NO_SSL=""
POSTGRES_USER=""

```

2. Push the schema to the database. You need to do this every time the schema in `src/server/db/schema.ts` changes.

```
pnpm run db:push
```

You can view the current state of the database and edit tables on Drizzle Studio.

```
 pnpm run db:studio
```

3. Download all dependencies. You need to do this every time a dependency in `package.json` changes.

```
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server.

```
pnpm run dev
```

After a second, you'll see this text appear in the terminal:

```
â–² Next.js 14.2.15
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the development server.

## Architecture

This project is built using **Next.js v14** using the App Router.

We use Neon **Postgres** as the database and **Drizzle** as the ORM. The schema for the database is in the `src/server/db` folder. It's a good starting point.

Most of the client-to-server communication is currently handled by Vercel **Server Actions**.
Server Actions allow us to execute database queries or API calls inside of a React component without needing to explicitly define an API route.
Note that Server Actions can only be defined in Server Components marked with the `use server` directive.
To make them available in Client Components marked with the `use client` directive, they must be imported or passed as a prop.
Server Actions are generally located in `actions.tsx` files distributed throughout `src/app`.

Authentication, authorization, and session management is handled by **Auth.js**.
We only support username/password authentication using the `Credentials` provider.
Sessions are stored in Json Web Tokens (JWTs) instead of database sessions.
The setup is in the `src/server/auth` folder.

Finally, on the frontend, we are using **Shadcn UI** components with the **Tailwind CSS** framework. Components are in the `src/components/ui` folder. With Tailwind, most styling is done inline. Use `tailwind.config.ts` to edit default colors.

```
colors: {
        // Main is the primary color of the site
        "main-bg": "#452c63",
        "main-text": "#faf7fd", // whiter than it should be, but we need the brightness
        "main-header": "#e7e3fc",
        "main-accent": "#d4a7fc",

        // Secondary is for text fields
        "secondary-bg": "#e7e3fc",
        "secondary-text": colors.gray[300], // This text goes with a dark background
        "secondary-accent": colors.black, // This text goes with a light background

        // Other backgrounds
        "footer-bg": "#322046",
        "nav-bg": "#452c63",
        "tooltip-bg": colors.gray[900],

        // Other text colors
        link: colors.blue[300],
        "correct-guess": colors.emerald[300],
        "partial-guess": colors.yellow[300],
        "incorrect-guess": colors.rose[300],
        error: colors.red[400],
      },
```

## Copying this repository

I recommend duplicating this repository for each hunt. If you want to get updates from the original repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a bare clone of this repository.

   ```
   git clone --bare https://github.com/brown-puzzle-hq/bph-site.git
   ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub. You will get a URL for this repository.

3. Mirror-push to the new repository.

   ```
   cd bph-site.git
   git push --mirror https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPOSITORY.git
   ```

4. Remove the temporary repository.

   ```
   cd ..
   rm -rf bph-site.git
   ```

5. Clone the new repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPOSITORY.git
   ```

6. Add the original repository as a remote branch `public`.

   ```
   git remote add public https://github.com/brown-puzzle-hq/bph-site.git
   ```

7. To get changes from the original repository, run

   ```
   git fetch public
   ```

8. To merge changes from the original repository, run

   ```
   git merge public/main
   ```

There is more information on the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository).

## Communication

We use Discord for admin messages and Resend for automated hunt emails. Discord message templates are written inline using format strings (example below). Email templates are located in `src/lib/email-template.tsx`.

```
// Message the guess channel
  const guessMessage = `ðŸ§© **Guess** by [${teamId}](https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/teams/${teamId}) on [${puzzleId}](https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/${puzzleId} ): \`${guess}\` [${isCorrect ? (solveType === "guess" ? "âœ“" : "**E** â†’ âœ“") : "âœ•"}]`;
  await sendBotMessage(guessMessage, "guess");
```

## Hunt Structure

Most of the customizable features of the hunt structure are in `hunt.config.ts`. Timestamps are in UTC but can be converted to local time using the `FormattedTime` component in `src/lib/time.tsx`. Edit `/puzzle/actions.ts` to change how it handles guesses and solves.

## Final Checks

Make sure that `hunt.config.ts` is correct.

Before registration starts,

1. Set `REGISTRATION_START_TIME` and `REGISTRATION_END_TIME`
2. Set `HUNT_START_TIME` and `HUNT_END_TIME`

Before the hunt starts,

1. Set `NUMBER_OF_GUESSES_PER_PUZZLE`
2. Set `INITIAL_PUZZLES` and `PUZZLE_UNLOCK_MAP`
3. Set `getTotalHints`

Make sure to check that you are reading documentation for Next.js with the App Router, not the Pages Router.

Auth.js is formerly known as NextAuth.js.
Most documentation out there is still for v4, so check that you are reading documentation for v5.
