## Copying the repository

I recommend duplicating the repository for each hunt. If you want to get updates from the original repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a bare clone of this repository.

   ```
   git clone --bare https://github.com/brown-puzzle-hq/bph-site.git
   ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub. You will get a URL for this repository.

3. Mirror-push to the new repository.

   ```
   cd bph-site.git
   git push --mirror https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPOSITORY.git
   ```

4. Remove the temporary repository.

   ```
   cd ..
   rm -rf bph-site.git
   ```

5. Clone the new repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPOSITORY.git
   ```

6. Add the original repository as a remote branch `public`.

   ```
   git remote add public https://github.com/brown-puzzle-hq/bph-site.git
   ```

7. To get changes from the original repository, run

   ```
   git fetch public
   ```

8. To merge changes from the original repository, run

   ```
   git merge public/main
   ```

There is more information on the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository).

## Setup

1. Populate the environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example` below). If you don't have a preexisting database, the easiest way to get started is to create a Neon Postgres database through Vercel.

```
# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional *required* environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Next Auth (required)
# You can generate a new secret on the command line with:
# openssl rand -base64 32
# https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret
AUTH_SECRET=""
AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Remember to change this for production
AUTH_DRIZZLE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/db

# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL=""
POSTGRES_DATABASE=""
POSTGRES_HOST=""
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=""
POSTGRES_URL=""
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=""
POSTGRES_URL_NO_SSL=""
POSTGRES_USER=""

# Communication (optional)
# https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HINT=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_GUESS=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_FINISH=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_FEEDBACK=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_TEAM=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_DEV=""

# https://resend.com/api-keys
RESEND_API_KEY=""
```

2. Push the schema to the database. You need to do this every time the schema in `src/server/db/schema.ts` changes.

   ```
   pnpm run db:push
   ```

   You can view the current state of the database and edit tables on Drizzle Studio.

   ```
   pnpm run db:studio
   ```

3. Download all dependencies. You need to do this every time a dependency in `package.json` changes.

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Start the development server.

   ```
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   After a second, you'll see this text appear in the terminal:

   ```
   â–² Next.js 14.2.15
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   - Environments: .env
   ```

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the development server.

## Architecture

The site is built using **Next.js v14** using the App Router. The databse is Neon **Postgres** with **Drizzle** ORM. The schema for the database is in the `src/server/db` folder.

Most of the client-to-server communication is currently handled by Vercel **Server Actions**.
Server Actions allow us to execute database queries or API calls inside of a React component without needing to explicitly define an API route.

Note that Server Actions can only be defined in Server Components marked with the `use server` directive. To make them available in Client Components marked with the `use client` directive, they must be imported or passed as a prop. Server Actions are generally located in `actions.ts` files distributed throughout `src/app`.

Authentication, authorization, and session management is handled by **Auth.js**.
The project only supports username/password authentication using the `Credentials` provider.
Sessions are stored in Json Web Tokens (JWTs). The setup is in the `src/server/auth` folder.

On the frontend, the site has **Shadcn UI** components with the **Tailwind CSS** framework. Components are in the `src/components/ui` folder. With Tailwind, most styling is done inline. Use `tailwind.config.ts` to edit default colors.

```
colors: {
        // Main is the primary color of the site
        "main-bg": "#452c63",
        "main-text": "#faf7fd", // whiter than it should be, but we need the brightness
        "main-header": "#e7e3fc",
        "main-accent": "#d4a7fc",

        // Secondary is for text fields
        "secondary-bg": "#e7e3fc",
        "secondary-text": colors.gray[300], // This text goes with a dark background
        "secondary-accent": colors.black, // This text goes with a light background

        // Other backgrounds
        "footer-bg": "#322046",
        "nav-bg": "#452c63",
        "tooltip-bg": colors.gray[900],

        // Other text colors
        link: colors.blue[300],
        "correct-guess": colors.emerald[300],
        "partial-guess": colors.yellow[300],
        "incorrect-guess": colors.rose[300],
        error: colors.red[400],
      },
```

## Files

### Hunt configuration

| Path                           | Description                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| .env                           | Environment variables            |
| src/env.js                     | Mirorrs .env for the application |
| src/hunt.config.ts             | Main hunt configuration file     |
| src/app/(hunt)/\*\*/actions.ts | Server Actions                   |
| src/middleware.ts              | Next.js request middleware       |

The `.env` files need to be set up first. It affects database, Discord, and Resend integration. If you add new environment variables, be sure to update `src/env.js` to reflect the changes.

Basic hunt settings are controlled via `src/hunt.config.ts`. More advanced logic (such as unlock structure) should be handled in the `actions.ts` files in the `src/app/(hunt)/components/puzzle/` folder.

In particular, the default unlock structure is **adjacency-based**. You can customize the `handleSolve` function in `src/app/(hunt)/components/puzzle/guess/actions.ts`.

| Path                                              | Functions                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ../puzzle/actions.ts                              | `canViewPuzzle`, `canViewHint`, `canViewSolution`, `canViewStats` |
| ../puzzle/components/puzzle/guess/actions.ts      | `handleGuess`, `handleSolve`                                      |
| ../puzzle/components/hint/actions.ts              | `insertHintRequest`, `editMessage`, `insertReply`                 |
| ../puzzle/components/puzzle-list/event/actions.ts | `insertAnswerToken`                                               |

Note that the site automatically protects certain pages depending on

1. Team role (admin, testsolver, user)
2. Time (before, during, or after `HUNT_START_TIME`)

To debug permissions problem, check

1. `src/middleware.ts`, which protects `/admin` pages
2. `canViewPuzzle`, `canViewHint`, `canViewSolution`, and `canViewStats` functions in `src/app/(hunt)/components/puzzle/actions.ts`, which protects `/puzzle` pages
3. `hunt.config.ts`, which controls the `HUNT_START_TIME`

### Next.js and Tailwind

| Path       | Description                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| \*.tsx     | React component                        |
| page.tsx   | Next.js page                           |
| layout.tsx | Next.js layout page                    |
| \*.ts      | Typescript file                        |
| actions.ts | Server Actions                         |
| folder   | Route segment                          |
| [folder] | Dynamic route segment                  |
| (folder) | Group routes without affecting routing |
| tailwind.config.ts | Tailwind configuration file with custom styles |
| styles/\*.css      | CSS file                                       |

Next.js supports Typescript (`*.ts`) and React components (`*tsx`). Folders inside of `src/app` are treated as route segments. For example, `src/app/(hunt)/page.tsx` represents the index page at `/`, and `src/app/(hunt)/puzzle/example/page.tsx` represents the page at `/puzzle/example`.

### Docs

| Path            | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| next.config.mjs | Next.js configuration files, contains MDX plugins                                           |
| /docs           | Docs folder                                                                                 |
| /scripts        | Scripts folder                                                                              |
| \*.md           | Markdown file                                                                               |
| page.mdx        | MDX (Markdown + React) file |
| \*.template.mdx | Handlebars template |

The docs are written in MDX (`*.mdx`). Note that `page.mdx` files are automatically gets converted into a normal page at built-time. 

Sometimes, its useful to provide snippets of the codebase inside of the docs. To do that:
1. Take a look at `/scripts/generate-docs.ts`, which is automatically called at runtime
2. Make a `*.template.mdx` file in the folder
3. Label the region that you want as a snippet 
4. Add the relevent paths and snippet names to `/scripts/generate-docs.ts`

## Communication

The site uses Discord for admin messages and Resend for automated hunt emails. Discord message templates are written inline using format strings (example below). Email templates are located in `src/lib/email-template.tsx`.

```
// Message the guess channel
  const guessMessage = `ðŸ§© **Guess** by [${teamId}](https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/teams/${teamId}) on [${puzzleId}](https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/${puzzleId} ): \`${guess}\` [${isCorrect ? (solveType === "guess" ? "âœ“" : "**E** â†’ âœ“") : "âœ•"}]`;
  await sendBotMessage(guessMessage, "guess");
```

## Final Checks

Make sure that `hunt.config.ts` is correct.

Before registration starts,

1. Set `REGISTRATION_START_TIME` and `REGISTRATION_END_TIME`
2. Set `HUNT_START_TIME` and `HUNT_END_TIME`

Before the hunt starts,

1. Set `NUMBER_OF_GUESSES_PER_PUZZLE`
2. Set `INITIAL_PUZZLES` and `PUZZLE_UNLOCK_MAP`
3. Set `getTotalHints`
