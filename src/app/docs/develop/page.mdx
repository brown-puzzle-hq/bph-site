#### Quick Links

Make sure to check that you are reading documentation for Next.js with the App Router, not the Pages Router.

Auth.js is formerly known as NextAuth.js.
Most documentation out there is still for v4, so check that you are reading documentation for v5.

#### Overview

This project is built using **Next.js v14** using the App Router. The frontend is in the `src/app` folder, and the backend is in the `src/server` folder.

We use Neon **Postgres** as the database and **Drizzle** as the ORM. The schema for the database is in the `src/server/db` folder. It's a good starting point.

Most of the client-to-server communication is currently handled by Vercel **Server Actions**.
Server Actions allow us to execute database queries or API calls inside of a React component without needing to explicitly define an API route.
Note that Server Actions can only be defined in Server Components marked with the `use server` directive.
To make them available in Client Components marked with the `use client` directive, they must be imported or passed as a prop.
Server Actions are generally located in `actions.tsx` files distributed throughout `src/app`.

Authentication, authorization, and session management is handled by **Auth.js**.
We only support username/password authentication using the `Credentials` provider.
Sessions are stored in Json Web Tokens (JWTs) instead of database sessions.
The setup is in the `src/server/auth` folder.

Finally, on the frontend, we are using **Shadcn UI** components with the **Tailwind CSS** framework. Components are in the `src/components/ui` folder.

#### Copying this repository

I recommend duplicating this repository for each hunt. If you probably want to get updates from the original repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a bare clone of this repository.

   ```
   git clone --bare https://github.com/brown-puzzle-hq/bph-site.git
   ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub. You will get an URL for this repository.

3. Mirror-push to the new repository.

   ```
   cd bph-site.git
   git push --mirror https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPOSITORY.git
   ```

4. Remove the temporary repository.

   ```
   cd ..
   rm -rf bph-site.git
   ```

5. Clone the new repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPOSITORY.git
   ```

6. Add the original repository as a remote branch `public`.

   ```
   git remote add public https://github.com/brown-puzzle-hq/bph-site.git
   ```

7. To get changes from the original repository, run

   ```
   git fetch public
   ```

8. To merge changes from the original repository, run

   ```
   git merge public/main
   ```

There is more information on the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository).

#### Setting up the database

1. Connect the database to the project

Take a look at `.env.example`. You will need to create a `.env` file at the root of your project and fill in database and the auth fields. If you don't have a preexisting database, the easiest thing to do is to sign up for a Neon Postgres database.

2. Push the schema to the database. This only needs to be done when you update the schema in `src/server/db/schema.ts`.

   ```
   pnpm run db:push
   ```

3. Run Drizzle studio to look at the database.

   ```
   pnpm run db:studio
   ```

#### Setting up the dev environment

1. Download all of the dependencies. This only needs to be done when you update the dependencies in `package.json`.

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server.

   ```
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the development server.

#### Hunt Structure

Most of the customizable features of the hunt structure is in `hunt.config.ts`.
Edit `/puzzle/actions.ts` to change how it handles guesses and solves.

#### Final Checks

Make sure that `hint.config.ts` is correct.

Before registration starts,

1. Set `REGISTRATION_START_TIME` and `REGISTRATION_END_TIME`
2. Set `HUNT_START_TIME` and `HUNT_END_TIME`

Before the hunt starts,

1. Set `NUMBER_OF_GUESSES_PER_PUZZLE`
2. Set `INITIAL_PUZZLES` and `PUZZLE_UNLOCK_MAP`
3. Set `getTotalHints`
