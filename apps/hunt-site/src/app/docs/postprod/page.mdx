3. [Creating puzzle bodies](#creating-puzzle-bodies)
4. [Creating copy text](#creating-copy-text)

## First steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Get the `.env` and put it under `/apps/hunt-site/`
3. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
4. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
5. Create a new branch on GitHub called `your-name-postprodding`

Now you're ready to postprod!

To run the development server and see your changes live:

1. Run `pnpm run dev` in the terminal
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Adding puzzles

1. Add the puzzle to the database

   First, run `pnpm run db:studio` and go to `https://local.drizzle.studio/`. You will see a lot of different tables, but the only one you need to edit is `hunt_site_puzzle`.

   ![drizzle-studio.png](/docs/drizzle-studio.png)

   The `name` column is the title of the puzzle, the `id` column is the slug (URL) for the puzzle, and the `answer` column is the answer to the puzzle in **all caps, no spaces.**

   ```ts
   {
       id: "example",
       name: "Example",
       answer: "ANSWER"
   }
   ```

2. Create a webpage for the puzzle

   Copy the `src/app/(hunt)/puzzle/example` folder to a sibling folder called `src/app/(hunt)/puzzle/your-puzzle-id`.
   Go to `https://localhost:3000/puzzle/your-puzzle-id` to see the new webpage.

   ```

   ```

3. **Add puzzle information in data.tsx.**

   `data.tsx` contains
   1. Puzzle id (required)
   2. Puzzle body (required) [[advice](#creating-puzzle-bodies)]
   3. Solution body
   4. Copy text [[advice](#creating-copy-text)]
   5. Partial solutions
   6. Extra tasks

   Set values to null or empty if they don't exist.

   ```ts
   export const puzzleId = "example";

   export const inPersonBody = (
       <div className="max-w-3xl text-center">This is the body of the puzzle.</div>
   );

   export const remoteBody = (
       <div className="max-w-3xl text-center">This is the body of the remote puzzle.</div>
   );

   export const solutionBody = (
       <div className="max-w-3xl text-center">This is an example solution.</div>
   );

   export const copyText = `1\t2\t3
   4\t5\t6
   7\t8\t9`;

   export const partialSolutions: Record<string, string> = {
       EXAMP: "Almost there!",
       EXAMPL: "Learn to spell!",
   };

   export const tasks: Record<string, JSX.Element> = {
       EX: (
           <div className="max-w-3xl text-center">
           This is a task unlocked by submitting EX.
           </div>
       ),
       EXAM: (
           <div className="max-w-3xl text-center">
           This is a task unlocked by submitting EXAM.
           </div>
       ),
   };
   ```

## Creating puzzle bodies

Puzzle bodies are written in JSX (HTML-in-JavaScript) and Tailwind CSS. There are also some Next.js components that you should use.
Here are some tips:

**General**

1. If the original puzzle is on a **Google Doc**, try exporting it as a Markdown file. Then put that in a Markdown-to-HTML converter like [this](https://markdowntohtml.com/).

2. AI tools are pretty good at web development. Remember to tell it that you're using Next.js (App Router) with Tailwind CSS.

**Lists, Images, and Videos**

3. For **images**, use the Next.js `Image` component instead of the `img` tag. Put it somewhere in the puzzle folder and import it like this:

   ```html
   import Image from "next/image"; import SUDOKU_IMAGE from
   "./solution/sudoku_image.png";
   <image src="{SUDOKU_IMAGE}" width="{500}" height="{500}" alt="" />
   ```

   Next.js documentation will tell you to put images in the `public` folder. We don't do that because it makes it harder to leak puzzle information.

4. For **videos**, I recommend uploading it to YouTube as unlisted. YouTube will give you a code embedding that you can copy. You'll have to change some properties to camelCase, so that it looks like this:

   ```html
   <iframe
     className="aspect-video w-full"
     src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XXXXXXXXXXX"
     title="YouTube video player"
     allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
     referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
     allowfullscreen
   ></iframe>
   ```

   You can also use `iframe` for Google Drive videos. The alternative is to download the video and serve it via an API route, but that gets a bit hairy.

**Appearance**

5. If you want to increase the vertical spacing between elements, use the `mb-4` utility class.

   ```html
   <div>
     <p className="mb-4">Solve this puzzle.</p>
     <image
       src="/puzzle/sudoku-51.png"
       width="{500}"
       height="{500}"
       alt=""
       className="mb-4"
     />
   </div>
   ```

6. If you need a space between a `p` and a `span`, use `{" "}`.

   ```html
   <p>This puzzle is{" "}<span className="underline">difficult</span>.</p>
   ```

7. If you want to **hide** some text, change the background using a `span`.

   ```html
   <p>The answer is{" "}<span className="bg-main-text">ANSWER</span>.</p>
   ```

## Creating copy text

1. Each copy text entry should either be plaintext (simple and faster) or HTML (which allows for text and cell formatting).

2. With **plaintext**, write a newline to move down a row and `\t` to move across a row. Make sure to wrap the string with backticks (`` ` ``) instead of single or double quotes.

   ```ts
   export const copyText = `one\ttwo
   three\tfour
   =IMAGE("https://www.puzzlehunt.com/home/Register.png")`;
   ```

   With **HTML**, you will have to use raw HTML `style` tags which differ slightly from Tailwind (used for puzzle and solution bodies). You might want to write the HTML elsewhere for syntax highlighting before placing it into the `copyText`.

   ```ts
   export const copyText = `<table>
       <tr>
           <td><b>Bold</b></td>
           <td><i>Italic</i></td>
           <td><u>Underline</u></td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
           <td><span style="color: red;">Red</span></td>
           <td style="background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid red;">Cell</td>
           <td style="background-color: yellow; border-top: 1px solid #452c63;">Cell</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
           <td>=IMAGE("https://www.puzzlehunt.com/home/Register.png")</td>
       </tr>
   </table>`;
   ```

3. You can make and format table(s) in Google Sheets, export them to HTML, and use that as a starting point.
