## Hinting

Hints can be issued on the [hinting page](/admin/hinting).

## Errata

Errata can be issued on the [errata page](/admin/errata). This will send an email out to every user team who has unlocked but not solved the puzzle.

## Teams

### Schema

```ts file=src/server/db/schema.ts:53-66
export const teams = createTable("team", {
  id: varchar("id", { length: 255 }).primaryKey(), // login username
  displayName: varchar("display_name", { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  password: varchar("password", { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  role: roleEnum("role").notNull().default("user"),
  members: text("members").notNull().default("[]"),
  interactionMode: interactionModeEnum("interaction_type").notNull(),
  createTime: timestamp("create_time", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
  finishTime: timestamp("finish_time", { withTimezone: true }),
});
```

The `id` is the username for logging in, and the `displayName` is what is shown on the leaderboard.

The `password` is hashed, so don't change it directly on the database. The only way to do it is to visit the individual teams page (more information [here](/resetting-passwords)).

The `role` determines the level of privileges for the team.
Generally, admins can access every part of the site (including `/admin`), testsolvers can view puzzles before the `HUNT_START_TIME` (defined in hunt.config.ts), and regular users can only see puzzles when the `HUNT_START_TIME` has passed.
Team roles can be toggled on the [teams table](/admin/teams).
The current role enum in this codebase is:

```ts file=src/server/db/schema.ts:24-26
export const roleEnum = pgEnum("role", ["admin", "user", "testsolver"]);
```

By default, teams have either an "in-person" or "remote" `interactionMode`
In-person and remote teams are on separate leaderboards and may see different versions of a puzzle.
Team interaction modes can be toggled on the [teams table](/admin/teams).
The current enum in this codebase is:

```ts file=src/server/db/schema.ts:28-33
export const interactionModeEnum = pgEnum("interaction_type", [
  "in-person",
  "remote",
]);
```

### The teams table

The [teams table](/admin/teams) contains all the teams registered on the site. Its features include:

1. Text filter
2. Interaction mode filter
3. Compact and regular view toggle
4. Pagination
5. Column sorting (by clicking on the column header)
6. Role and interaction mode editing (by clicking on the cell)

The table contains the following columns:

1. Trophy: leaderboard ranking
2. Puzzle: # puzzles solved
3. ID
4. Display name
5. Role
6. Mode
7. Create time
8. Finish team

### Adding the first admin

This is likely a task for the tech team. They need to:

1. Launch drizzle studio by running `pnpm run db:studio`
2. Visit [https://local.drizzle.studio/](https://local.drizzle.studio/)
3. Add the first admin on the teams table

### Adding new admins

This can be done on the [teams table](/admin/teams).

1. Have the admin [register](/register) on the site
2. Find the team on the [teams table](/admin/teams)
3. Toggle the **Role** cell
4. Save your changes

### Adding new testsolvers

This can be done on the [teams table](/admin/teams).

1. Have the testsolvers [register](/register) on the site
2. Find the team on the [teams table](/admin/teams)
3. Toggle the **Role** cell
4. Save your changes

### Changing interaction modes

This can be done on the [teams table](/admin/teams).

1. Find the team on the [teams table](/admin/teams)
2. Toggle the **Mode** cell
3. Save your changes

### Resetting passwords

This can be done on individual teams pages.

The password is hashed, so do not edit the password column on the database directly.

1. Get the team username
2. Go to /team/[username]
3. Reset and save the password

### Emailing teams

We ask every team to leave an email for us to contact. The easiest way to get a list of emails is to use the [queries editor](/admin/sql).

### Texting teams

The easiest way to contact individual teams is to find their team username and go to the profile page at /teams/[username].

## Navigation

This site is divided into three areas: [/](/) (hunt), [/docs](/docs), and [/admin](/admin). You can navigate by opening up the command palette (`Cmd-K`or`Ctrl-K`).
