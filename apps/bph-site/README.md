## Quick Start

1. Set up the environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example` below). If you don't have a preexisting database, the easiest way to get started is to use the Neon Postgres database.

  ```
  ```example file=.env.example
# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional *required* environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Next Auth (required)
# You can generate a new secret on the command line with:
# openssl rand -base64 32
# https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret
AUTH_SECRET=""
AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Remember to change this for production
AUTH_DRIZZLE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/db

# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL=""
POSTGRES_DATABASE=""
POSTGRES_HOST=""
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=""
POSTGRES_URL=""
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=""
POSTGRES_URL_NO_SSL=""
POSTGRES_USER=""

# Communication (optional)
# https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HINT=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_GUESS=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_FINISH=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_FEEDBACK=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_TEAM=""
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_DEV=""

# https://resend.com/api-keys
RESEND_API_KEY=""
```
  ```

2. Push the schema to the database. You need to do this every time the schema in `src/server/db/schema.ts` changes.

  ```
  pnpm run db:push
  ```

  You can look at the current state of the database by visiting Drizzle Studio.

  ```
   pnpm run db:studio
  ```

3. Download all dependencies. You need to do this every time the dependencies in `package.json` changes.

  ```
  pnpm install
  ```

4. Start the development server.

  ```
  pnpm run dev
  ```

  After a second, you'll see this text appear in the terminal:

  ```
  â–² Next.js 14.2.15
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env
  ```
  
  Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the development server.
